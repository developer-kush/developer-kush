# 👋 Hey, I'm Kushagra Agarwal

I’m a **Software Engineer & Competitive Programmer** who enjoys building fast, clean, scalable systems.  
Right now, I work in **Rapido’s Customer Backend Team**, designing **high-scale, low-latency distributed services** that power millions of user interactions.

Outside work, I grind **LeetCode**, compete on **Codeforces (Expert)**, and build projects that make developers' lives easier — like **Snippet Flow**, a fast, open-source CLI registry for files & components built in Go.
